title: MD5 Password Cracker In Python
---

I am in a Distributed Computing class this semester. We just had to write a brute-force password cracker using the Condor grid we have on-campus. It really took forever to generate an 8 character (a-z) code even though I ran it 676 different times. Total run-time was about 25 minutes. Anyways, we also had to create a password cracker using a dictionary file. I thought this was an awesome project and it was so much faster! I’ve decided to post the dictionary Python script. It should crack any word, given that it is in whatever dictionary you choose to use it against. My word for the project was “schnecke”, which is German for “snail”. Knowing that, I checked it against the Ubuntu New German dictionary. The run-time was ~.3 secs.

Check it out!

P.S. In order to get language dictionaries to check against in Ubuntu, it is as easy as “apt-get install ngerman” or whatever language package you need. I found a list of these packages with a quick Google search. If you’re doing more evil than good, you can also easily find a list of “common passwords” in text form.
