        <p>Hi, welcome to my personal blog. I plan to use this site to document interesting things I've learned on personal projects. I work extensively with OpenStack and Linux at work and tend to try new functionality at home. Because I'm forgetful, I'll write up the the cool things I find in order to keep from asking myself, "How in the heck did I do that?!?!" over and over again.</p>
