              <p>Welp, after a long time away from anything blog related, I’ve decided to spin up a new site to start trying to keep better documentation of the stuff I do personally. A friend of mine asked about my old blog last week and, after telling me that he had liked to read it, I decided that maybe now was as good a time as any to get back into the swing of things. Life has changed quite a bit since the old entries I had made on my previous site, so the focus of my write-ups here will be pretty drastically different.</p>

<p>I had originally stopped writing mainly because, as graduation neared at Clemson, I was short on time and frantically trying to find a job to transition to ASAP. I also didn’t want to pay yearly for a domain name and to host my site somewhere. So in getting back into this, I have made the transition to Github Pages as a free spot to host my stuff. Pages uses the Jekyll framework to host static sites, which sounded like a neat platform to try out. This has also given me a chance to use git in a different way and learn the markdown syntax. I hope that I’ll be able to expand on these skills more in the future.</p>

<p>As for most of my new posts, they’ll probably center around the creation of this site (it took me a while to figure out the simplest path forward for Jekyll + Bootstrap), Linux system administration, OpenStack oddities and how-tos, and automation tools like Chef and Ansible. Finally, in regards to my older stuff, I was able to dig the old site out of the archive.org Wayback Machine (hooray for not keeping backups), so I’ve ported a few of the ones that were still somewhat interesting to this site. </p>

<p>Hope you like it!</p>

          <h4>About</h4>
          <p>Hi, welcome to my personal blog. I plan to use this site to document interesting things I've learned on personal projects. I work extensively with OpenStack and Linux at work and tend to try new functionality at home. Because I'm forgetful, I'll write up the the cool things I find in order to keep from asking myself, "How in the heck did I do that?!?!" over and over again.</p>
